        "In this assignment we consider the following phenomenon. Have you ever called the help-desk of an organization; say, a webshop. Chances are that when you did, you were told that the customer queue was longer than average and you were kindly asked to wait. When you complained about this to your friends, almost all of them had the same experience. How can it be the case that everyone has to wait longer than average? Surely, this is a scam and the helpdesk is under-staffed? It probably is under-staffed, but the outcome is consistent with the webshop telling the truth.\n",

There are one-on-one supervision classes, tutorials with 10 students, interactive lectures with 50 students and big lectures with 100 and 200 students resp. In the school schedule each of these classe sizes are offered equally often in a week (do not worry about whether this is actually possible; simply assume that there is a uniform distribution over the class sizes). Hence the school advertises with an average class size of 72.2.\n",

        "The intuition of the result is strongly based on sampling bias. The school is calculating an average based on the different class sizes with equal weight. So an average of (1, 10, 50, 100, 200) would be 72. This average is of course strongly biased, since the gross of the students is part of the larger classes. For example, a class of 200 students contributes 200 responses, whereas a class of 1 student contributes only 1 response. For this reason, using our code finding the student-reported average it is logical that it is skewed toward larger class sizes, which inflates the perceived average size to 146. The result is roughly twice the advertised average because the larger classess dominate the sampled data."
